# Development guidelines
guidelines:
  - Follow PRD specifications strictly
  - Implement phases sequentially as outlined in ROADMAP.md
  - Test each component before moving to next phase
  - Rate limiting: 2-3s for Bahamut, 1.5s for MAL, 5s for Douban
  - Accept 70% cross-platform coverage as success criteria
  - Keep UI simple and intuitive (no instructions needed)

# Important notes
notes:
  - Search query clears all other filters (PRD requirement)
  - Genre filter uses OR logic (not AND)
  - Missing ratings displayed last in sort order
  - Bahamut ratings are 1-5 scale (normalize to 0-10 for composite)
  - Total composite weights must equal 100%
